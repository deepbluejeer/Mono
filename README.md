# Mono

Being a recent graduate at the time, I wanted to develop as many games as possible. Mono was my first serious, commercially-focused game.
What inspired me was a mini-game in Virtue's Last Reward, where you pressed buttons to light other buttons.

I did my own twist on the lighting-buttons-idea: the game uses three buttons (triangles, squares and hexagons) and they light buttons that are close.

The difference between each shape is that they only light buttons that are next to the edges. So the triangles can light three other buttons, squares can light four etc.

I focused on programming the game in a way that anyone could create new levels using the editor. 
You only need to drag the shapes into the editor, transform them into a prefab and the game understands if every shape is lit or what shape should get lit.
